# Selenium with Edge WebDriver Example

This repository demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver with Microsoft Edge. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers and is functional across different browsers, operating systems, and programming languages.

## What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It supports automation across different browsers, platforms, and programming languages. Selenium can be used for web scraping, testing web applications, and automating repetitive web tasks.

### Components of Selenium:

1. **Selenium WebDriver**: A collection of language-specific bindings to drive a browser.
2. **Selenium IDE**: A Chrome and Firefox plugin that allows you to record and playback tests in the browser.
3. **Selenium Grid**: A tool to run tests in parallel across different machines and browsers.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Microsoft Edge browser
- Microsoft Edge WebDriver

### Installing Dependencies

First, you need to install Selenium. You can do this using pip:

```sh
pip install selenium
```

### Setting Up Edge WebDriver

1. Download the Edge WebDriver that matches your browser version from the [official site](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).
2. Ensure the WebDriver executable is in your system PATH. Alternatively, you can specify the path directly in your script.

## Example Code

Below is an example Python script that uses Selenium with the Edge WebDriver. This script opens Edge, navigates to a webpage, and performs a simple action such as searching for a term on a search engine.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

# Set the path to the Edge WebDriver
webdriver_path = "path/to/your/msedgedriver"

# Initialize the Edge WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Edge(executable_path=webdriver_path)

# Open a webpage
driver.get("https://www.google.com")

# Find the search box using its name attribute value
search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")

# Type in the search query
search_query = "Selenium WebDriver with Edge"

# Press Enter
search_box.send_keys(search_query + Keys.RETURN)

# Wait for a few seconds to see the results
time.sleep(5)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. **Importing the Necessary Modules**: The `webdriver`, `By`, and `Keys` modules are imported from Selenium. `time` is used to add delays in the script.

2. **Setting the WebDriver Path**: Specify the path to your Edge WebDriver executable. Ensure it's correctly set up on your system.

3. **Initializing the WebDriver**: `webdriver.Edge(executable_path=webdriver_path)` initializes the Edge WebDriver.

4. **Opening a Webpage**: `driver.get("https://www.google.com")` opens Google in the Edge browser.

5. **Finding the Search Box**: `driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")` finds the search box element on the page by its name attribute.

6. **Typing the Search Query**: `search_box.send_keys(search_query + Keys.RETURN)` types the search query into the search box and simulates pressing the Enter key.

7. **Waiting and Closing**: `time.sleep(5)` waits for 5 seconds to allow the user to see the search results, and `driver.quit()` closes the browser.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the basic usage of Selenium with the Edge WebDriver. You can extend this script to perform more complex actions and interactions with web pages, such as form submissions, clicking buttons, and extracting data.
